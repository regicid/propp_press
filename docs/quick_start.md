# Quick Start

## Google Colab Hands-on Tutorial

[`This Notebook`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UqHVJrxCFCufpY9o-WRBGWdrQFdgnljD?usp=sharing) will guide you through the process of analyzing a French novel using the propp-fr library. 


You'll learn how to load a novel, tokenize it, extract named entities, resolve coreferences, and analyze the main characters.

## Installation

The French variant of the Propp python library can be installed via [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/propp-fr/):

```bash
pip install propp_fr
```

## Oneliner Processing

You can process a text file in one line with the default models:

```python
from propp_fr import process_text_file

process_text_file("root_directory/my_french_novel.txt")
```

This will generate three additional files in the same directory:

```
root_directory/
├── my_french_novel.txt
├── my_french_novel.tokens
├── my_french_novel.entities
└── my_french_novel.book
```

- `my_french_novel.tokens` contains all tokens along with:

    - Part-of-speech tags
    - Syntactic parsing information  

- `my_french_novel.entities` contains information about recognized entities, including:

    - Start and end positions  
    - Entity type  

- `my_french_novel.book` contains all characters and their attributes, including:

    - Coreference information  
    - Gender, number, and other features  

## Reloading Processed Files

Generated files can be loaded by:

```python
from propp_fr import load_text_file, load_tokens_df, load_entities_df, load_book_file

file_name = "my_french_novel"
root_directory = "root_directory"

text_content = load_text_file(file_name, root_directory)
tokens_df = load_tokens_df(file_name, root_directory)
entities_df = load_entities_df(file_name, root_directory)
characters_dict = load_book_file(file_name, root_directory)
```

## Yes No Flowchart

Did you define your entity types (annotation guidelines)?  
  -> No -> [Annotation Guidelines](sacr_dataset_annotation/#annotation-guidelines)  
Is there an annotated dataset containing those entities? (See [Available Dataset](available_datasets/))  
  -> No -> Annotate Dataset  
In the right language?  
  -> No -> Annotate Dataset (at least **test set** to evaluate model) OR Transfer Annotations OR Train a multilingual model  
Is there a pretrained model available?  
-> Is performance acceptable? (see [Dataset Benchmarks](datasets_benchmarks/))  
Yes -> Use the pretrained model  
No -> Train and Evaluate a new model (how to improve model section: ablation, dataset size (tokens, mentions, monoentity), embedding model, model architecture)
